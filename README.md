# Web-Server-Plugin-Spigot
This plugin, made with java for bukkitAPI-supporting servers such as spigot, is an example repository for implementing the http protocol to a running minecraft server. In other words, it basically starts a website with the minecraft server.
###Supports spigot version 1.8.8, should also fully support any other spigot 1.8 server, and the code itself (NOT the compiled .jar file, the .java files!) should work for the near future (1.9-1.10+), but please report if any problem does show up in any version.
